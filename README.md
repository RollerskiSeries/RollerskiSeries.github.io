## Making Changes
To publish changes, edit the file you want and then "Commit changes". This will push an update online after a few minutes. All changes are recorded so it is possible to revert to an old version. 

## Rules
These are written in markdown in rules.md. This is quite flexible to edit

## Race details
These are contained in json format in races.js. It is possible to edit the details and add / remove races with caution not to alter the format (this is fairly sensitive).
