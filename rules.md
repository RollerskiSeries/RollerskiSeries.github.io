# British Roller Ski Series Rules of Competition

#### Revision for 2024

## Introduction
The British Roller Ski Series was re-established in 2004 by the former Snowsport GB Nordic Executive to encourage increased participation in the sport of cross-country skiing. An important aim of the Series is to encourage participation and to offer fair competition open to all standards of skiers.

The organisers of any Series race must agree to abide by these general rules, although the actual local race rules are the responsibility of each event organiser. They should follow generally accepted roller ski race rules with modifications for local conditions; the Series Directors are available for advice.

## General
- Series Directors will be appointed each year. For 2024 the Series Directors are:
    - Adam Pinney,aapinney@ntlworld.com, Tel.: 01582 602995.
    - Peter Thomson, peter@urban-ski-patrol.co.uk.
- The Series Directors will adjudicate on rules and any disputes that cannot be resolved by race organisers.
- Competitions are open to all nationalities although there may be specific trophies awarded to UK citizens or residents of the UK.
- __All prospective race organisers must inform the Series Directors of their intention to run a British Series event. The Series Directors must approve the request and inform the race organisers accordingly.__
- The Series will have a dedicated webpage, hosted by BMCCSA, www.bmccsa.org.uk.

## Duties of the Series Directors
- To invite clubs affiliated to their Home Nation governing body or organisations to host a race.
- To handle and account for any money raised from donations or sponsorship collected
specifically for the Series. This money shall be used for trophies/prizes or other expenditure related to the Series.
- To assist/advise organising clubs on the organisation of their race.
- To keep the Series website up-to-date by posting up-coming race information, race results with Series point, Series standings, photos and other relevant information.
- To approve each venue and race format. The Series Directors shall be notified by 31 March of venue and race format and will approve and announce events by the 15 April. The Series Directors may vary these timescales at their discretion.
- To notify/advertise races through the BMCCSA website, Home Nations Governing Bodies, , clubs and other appropriate channels.

## Races and venues
- A minimum of five events shall comprise the Series. More events may be added at the discretion of the Series Directors and with the agreement of the event organiser.
- Races should have an even distribution around the UK covering the general areas: southern England, central England, northern England and Scotland.

## Categories and other provisions

Age shall be determined by competitor's age on the 31 December prior to the start of the Series season. For 2024, categories shall be:
- __Veteran__: over 40 (born 1983 or earlier) / __Super Veteran__: over 60 (born 1963 or earlier)
- __Senior__: over 18 (born 2005 or earlier)

    The Veteran, Super Veteran and Senior categories will generally race together in one group. These categories do not have upper ages.

- __Youth Under 18__ (born 2006 or 2007)
- __Youth Under 16__ (born 2008 or 2009)

    Under 16s and Under 18s will race together in one group. For British Series positions, points will be allocated to each category separately.

- __Junior youth Under 14__ (born 2010 or 2011)
- __Junior youth Under 12__ (born 2012 or later)

    Under 12s and Under 14s will race together in one group. For British Series positions, points will be allocated to each category separately.

- __Para Nordic__, comprising Standing class and Sitting class – all ages and genders. All results will use race times directly, not the disability-percentage system used in larger Para Nordic events.
- __Open Class__ – Open to everyone of all ages and identities. The home nations have published guidance on this subject, see https://www.snowsportengland.org.uk/governance/. Currently, however, it is up to each race organiser to decide whether they wish to include an Open Class, and it is not used for Series classifications.

Categories for individual races may be combined, or further ones added at the discretion of the Race Organisers. However, for the British Series, results shall show at least the above categories.

Each category except the para category and Open Class (if relevant) above shall have male and female sub-categories. Youths and juniors may race in an older category at any event, in which case they score Series points only in the category in which they race for that event.

Organisers shall verify the dates of birth for all age categories. DOBs may be recorded by organisers but not sent or distributed in any form or by any means.

With the aim of encouraging friendly rivalry and promoting additional interest to the Series, skiers must declare their club allegiance (if relevant) at the first Series race they enter; this may not be changed for the remainder of the Series.

Race organisers need to say which race distance corresponds to which age category for scoring GB Series Points. For example:

> *“The longest distance race is for the Under 16s, Under 18s, Seniors and Veterans. The shorter distance race is for the Novices, Under 12s and Under 14s”*
    
Participants have to indicate, when they enter a race, which category they wish to race in. They may race in a shorter race than that for their age but, in such case, Series points will be awarded firstly to all competitors in the longer designated race and then to competitors in the shorter race using the Points Scoring System below.

## British Championship
- One event per year shall be designated the British Championship. This venue should move to a different venue/region each year. To become British Champion, skiers must be British passport holders (although the race itself will be open to all skiers).
- The British champions shall be the winners of at least all categories for the British Series; the event organiser may designate sub-categories.
- Wherever practicable, the British Championship should use matched roller skis.
- Race results shall indicate British championship winners.

## Trophies
- The club organising each event shall be responsible for any trophies/prizes awarded at its
event.
- The designated British Roller Ski Championship organisers are responsible for trophies/prizes for this competition. They may approach the GBS Nordic Committee, clubs or other organisations for support.
- Trophies for overall Series winners in all categories are held by the winners for one year and shall then be returned to the Series Director. When these trophies need replacing, the Series Directors may approach the GBS Nordic Committee, the British Masters or others for support.
- The British Masters Cross Country Ski Association will provide trophies for the Veteran and Super Veteran categories.
- The Bob Lacy Memorial Trophy shall be presented to the first male Veteran (40+) in the British
Roller Ski Championship, irrespective of nationality but resident in the UK. The trophy shall be returned for presentation at the following year’s British Championships.

## General race rules
- Competitors under the age of 16 shall have their entry forms signed by their parents, guardians or responsible adult.
- Entry forms shall contain the option to withhold permission for photographs to be published.
- The minimum safety equipment of appropriate safety helmet (e.g. cycle safety helmet) and eye protection shall be worn. Gloves and elbow and knee pads are optional.
- Each event organiser shall decide on local race format and rules.
- The event organiser, or an appointed Race Director or Panel, shall adjudicate on disputes.
- The event organiser shall:
    - decide entry fees,
    - decide whether free or classic technique is used,
    - specify the type of roller ski to be used,
    - ensure that race distances are appropriate to age categories,
    - perform a Risk Assessment and ensure that a safe course has been set. Additional care shall be taken for Under 12s and Under 14s. It may also be appropriate to run a novice race on a flatter, less difficult course. It is the responsibility of each individual skier, or their parent, guardian or responsible adult, to decide whether they are capable of skiing the course.
- A British Series event may be decided upon one individual race or the combination of several races.
- The race organisers must provide the Series Director with their race results as soon as possible after the event, preferably within seven days. This Results Sheet should contain the following information:

|NAME|CLUB|RACE NO.|GENDER|AGE CATEGORY|ABILITY OR STATUS|TIME|OVERALL POSITION|CATEGORY POSITION|
|----|----|--------|------|------------|-----------------|----|----------------|-----------------|
||||Male|Under 12|Novice||||
||||Female|Under 14|Experienced||||
||||Open|Undere 16|||||
||||Senior|||||
||||Veteran|||||
||||Super Veteran|||||
||||Para|||||

- Entrants must indicate, in the table above (under “Club”), that they are members of an affiliated Home Nations club, that they are in the military or that they are members of an organisation which provides insurance (e.g. BBU). Note that “BNDS”, for example, is not a ‘club’, but entrants may give this information in addition to listing a club.

- In deciding local rules, it is recommended that F.I.S. rules for cross-country skiing are followed where appropriate (may be viewed on website at www.fis-ski.com). For example, the following extracts from the __F.I.S. Book II Cross-Country – The International Ski Competition Rules__ may be helpful:

    __340.1.3__ When overtaking, competitors must not obstruct each other.
  
    __340.1.6__ The competitors must comply with the instructions of competition officials.
  
    __353.1.1__ When using hand-timing, the time is taken when the competitor&#39;s first foot crosses the finish line.

- Although it is encouraged that all participants in the Series be members of clubs affiliated to their respective national governing bodies, it is recognised that, for a variety of reasons, not all skiers will be members of affiliated clubs. No non-affiliated skier will be prevented from entering a Series race as long as they have appropriate insurance. Points scoring system
- Points will be awarded in the categories as follows: Junior youth Under 12s, Junior youth Under 14s, Youth Under 16s Youth Under 18s, Senior, Veteran and Super Veteran and Para categories combined, but separately for males and females using the table below.
- Veterans and Super Veterans shall score points in the one or two categories below their own.
As examples, a female Super Veteran finishing third in a race with one Senior and one Veteran ahead shall score: 50 points as Super Veteran (winner), 45 points as Veteran (second) and 42 points (third) as Senior. In a male race where the first three positions are Super Veteran, Veteran and Senior, the Super Veteran shall receive 50 points (winner) in each of the Senior, Veteran and Super Veteran categories; the Veteran shall receive 45 points (second) in the Senior and Veteran categories; the Senior shall receive 42 points (third) in the Senior Category.

|Position|Points|Position|Points|Position|Points|Position|Points|

|1|50|12|32|23|21|34|10|
|2|45|13|31|24|20|35|9|
|3|42|14|30|25|19|36|8

|11|33|22|22|33|11| | |

- __Seniors, Veterans and Super Veterans__ will be awarded points from their best results on the following basis:
    - if five races are run, no results will be discounted and all five (or fewer) results will count towards the Series,
    – if six or more races are run, the competitor’s worst results will be discounted and the emaining five results will count towards the Series.

- __Under 12s, Under 14s, Under 16s and Under 18s__ will be awarded points from their best results on the following basis:
    – a maximum of five races will count towards the Series.

To obtain the maximum number of scoring races, competitors must race in both England and Scotland with at least one race result from both an English and a Scottish venue (a competitor racing in either England or Scotland only will have at best one fewer race counting towards their Series points than the maximum shown above). There is, however, no obligation on any competitor to race in both countries or in all Series races to become a GB Series age category winner.

- __Novice competitors__. A stated aim of this Series is to promote participation. If at any event a novice race is run in any age category, and not all points have been allocated in the main race, the novice competitors shall be placed behind the competitors in the main race until all available Series points are utilised (that is the first 43 places). A novice competitor must declare whether they are entering the main race or shorter race.
- __A competitor may race as a novice for up to two races only (their 1st and 2nd race)__. The overall Series points for anyone having raced as a novice will be the combination of their points from their novice race(s) and any subsequent points. If, however, they manage to race a further four or more competitive races in the same season then the best five results (from novice and experienced) will apply.
- The British Series winner for each category will be the competitor that obtains the most points in that category.
- In the event of a tie, the competitor with most victories in the races which count for their overall Series position shall win. If there is still a tie, the competitor with most second places shall win, and so on until a winner is decided, unless this does not lead to a winner.
- If competitors have an equal number of points and places, the competitor with better placing in their counting races over the other competitor or competitors shall win.
